# GAN-based Models in Defect Detection Survey

This repository contains the source code and related resources for our latest paper titled "*A Survey on GAN-based Models in Defect Detection*" (under review). In this paper, we present an extensive survey of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based models used in defect detection.

## Contents

-   **Datasets:** This section provides information about the datasets used in our survey. It includes links to the dataset-related databases and any additional information necessary for defect detection domain.
    
-   **Improved Public Models:** We discuss the latest GAN-based models in this domain from various and state-of-the-art models.

## Updates

This repository is regularly updated to include new findings, enhancements, and improvements related to GAN-based models in defect detection. We will provide the latest updates in the notes section below.

**Note:** No update since this paper is under peer review.

We encourage readers and researchers to explore this repository and contribute to the advancement of defect detection using GAN-based models.

If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact us.
